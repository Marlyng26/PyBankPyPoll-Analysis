In this challenge,  the responsibility of writing a Python script to analyze a company's financial records was given . [budget data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget data.csv) is a set of financial data that it provided. Date and Profit/Losses are the two columns in the dataset.My  goal was to write a Python script that analyzes the records and computes the following:

* This is the total number of months in the dataset.

* Over the entire period, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses"

* Over the course of the period, calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses," then find the average of those changes.

* The year in which profits increased the most (date and amount)


Then in the following challenge, it was entrusted with assisting a tiny, rural community in modernizing its voting system.[election data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election data.csv) was sent to me as a set of poll data. Voter ID, County, and Candidate make up the dataset's three columns. 

* The number of votes cast in total.

* A list of all the candidates who earned votes.
*
* * The number of votes each candidate received.

* The amount of votes each candidate received in total.

* The election winner determined by popular vote.



The analysis provided that one had to be flexible. The codes sometimes do not work as intended or result in error due to minor discrepncies. This analysis provided one was attentive to detail was critical for growth as a coder. In addition, it required problem solving skills to accurately perfrom analysis.
