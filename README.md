In this challenge, I was given the responsibility of writing a Python script to analyze your company's financial records. [budget data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget data.csv) is a set of financial data that I provided. Date and Profit/Losses are the two columns in the dataset.My  goal was to write a Python script that analyzes the records and computes the following:

* This is the total number of months in the dataset.

* Over the entire period, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses"

* Over the course of the period, calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses," then find the average of those changes.

* The year in which profits increased the most (date and amount)


Then in the following challenge, I was entrusted with assisting a tiny, rural community in modernizing its voting system.[election data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election data.csv) was sent to me as a set of poll data. Voter ID, County, and Candidate make up the dataset's three columns. My assignment was to write a Python script that examines the votes and calculates the following:

* The number of votes cast in total.

* A list of all the candidates who earned votes.
*
* * The number of votes each candidate received.

* The amount of votes each candidate received in total.

* The election winner determined by popular vote.
